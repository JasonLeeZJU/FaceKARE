            <p class="contentP">I had Botox and Juvederm injections previously, which made me so disappointed in the treatment. Not only wasted about 45 days but very expensive. I would never try that again. I am planning to have a facelift within the next 2 year (currently age 58).Fortunately for me, last night I attended a beauty gathering party where I met a representative from FaceKARE company. and she offered to do my face. At first I said no, because if it worked I didn't want to have one side of my face lifted and the other side still sagging. She said she'd do both sides so I agreed - but skeptical. After using 5 days consecutively, I was AMAZED at the difference!! Even my families said I looked younger. I hadnâ€™t buy it that day immediately, but I called that representative later and told her I wound buy their product now. Meanwhile, I bought their beauty masks, totally about 30 sheets. I've included two photos - you can see the difference in those deep furrows between the bridge of my nose, and the whole of my face go out of edema. I'm not a very good self photo taker!</p>
