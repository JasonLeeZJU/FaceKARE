            <p class="contentP">Microcurrent is one of the hottest innovations in the anti-aging industry and is used in top spas and medical offices for facial contouring, toning and firming of aging skin. Microcurrent is a low-level current that mimics the bodyâ€™s natural current and can provide both instant and cumulative results. Because microcurrent works sub-sensory, the treatment is soothing and most clients feel nothing at all.</p>

        <div class="contentText">
            <p class="contentP">It is a safe and effective technology for clients who wish to attain and maintain a healthier, younger looking appearance.</p>

            <p class="contentP">Microcurrent is capable of facial stimulation, sending soft, gentle waves through the skin, tissues and down to the facial muscles. Microcurrent has been shown to stimulate ATP production, which drives the creation of key structural proteins, such as collagen and elastin.</p>

        <div class="contentText">
            <p class="contentP">This increased ATP also energizes the facial muscles, similar to how exercise energizes the muscles of our bodies. Unlike anywhere else on the body, the facial muscles are directly connected to the skin, so the result of energizing the muscle is often an improved, lifted appearance.</p>
