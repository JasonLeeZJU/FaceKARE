            <p class="contentP">Mineral sunscreens may actually be better for your skin than their chemical counterparts, despite traditionally being known for being chalky, thick and very very white, recent developments suggest.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="contentText">
            <p class="contentP">As mineral-based sunscreens physically block UV, containing ingredients such as titanium dioxide and zinc oxide, rather than filtering the rays like chemical versions, they have been seen in the past as "less user-friendly", with obvious stickiness and whiteness. These side effects are perhaps one reason why a recent survey by the British Association of Dermatologists found that 80 percent of individuals are failing to adequately apply sunscreen before going out in the sun.</p>

            <p class="contentP">Nowadays, however, as Dr Anjali Mahto, the consultant dermatologist at the Cadogan Clinic, explains, the technology behind mineral sunscreens has not only vastly improved – "new formulations are made of much smaller particles, so can rub into the skin without leaving residue" – but they may also be " better for the skin than chemical sunscreens, especially if you're prone to acne or other skin ailments".</p>
