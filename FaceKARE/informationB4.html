            <p class="contentP">Hello Giggles spoke with Great Neck, New York-based dermatologist Dr. Jeannette Graf, who said swimming in your makeup is not actually that bad for you. And in some cases, it might be almost good for your skin. Will wonders never cease!</p>

        <div class="contentText">
            <p class="contentP">Dr. Graf says that if you get in the water with makeup, that can be fine, but once you get out, it's a good idea to clean your face. (This information applies to both salt water and chlorinated water.)</p>

            <p class="contentP">If you plan on wearing makeup in the water, she suggests applying sunscreen first, and then putting on water resistant makeup with SPF protection.</p>
